# IGME-760 AI Decision Making HW Assignment
This repository contains the code and assets used for my HW 3 submission for IGME-760.<br>
In this project the player/main character will pursue a magic orb to collect its power.<br>
If the main character encounters enemies in its FOV, they will activate their magic shield to<br>
defend oncoming attacks. If the enemies encounter the main character they will start pursuing<br>
them and attack if they are in range. Each character utilizes its own finite state machine to control<br>
their behavior and utilize a variety of different components for detection and achieving their goals.<br>
While navigating the level, each character also utilizes the A* algorithm for finding the shortest path and avoiding obstacles.
